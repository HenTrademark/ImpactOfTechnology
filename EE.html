        <h4>In the pursuit of new technology, people have started to throw away more devices than ever before. This has the capacity to really damage ecosystems as some components we throw away are made of mercury and radioactive materials which can contaminate water supplies. These are also shipped to third-world countries to be disposed of which is immoral</h4>
        <h4>The introduction of computerised devices has lead to more electricity being required to power these. One of the most effective ways to combat this is to use  fossil fuels for energy, however these emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which contribute to global warming and climate change. Due to this, the rate of climate change has been accelerating, warning us that we need to change some things if we want to keep this world safe for everyone.</h4>

        <hr class="w3-round">
        <h4>Currently, there are a few things that you can do to avoid these effects.</h4>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><b>Advocate for renewable energy sources.</b> Right now, renewable energy sources are the way to combat the current effects on the planet. If everyone puts in some effort to use renewable energy resources then the world would be in a better place</li>
            <li><b>Stop throwing phones away.</b> Something as simple as getting the new iPhone every year can harm the planet in a <i>big</i> way because of the harm it can do to ecosystems through waste. Taking the time to use your devices for as long as you can before recycling them would be better for the environment</li>
            <li><b>Try and buy environmentally-friendly technology.</b> If you were to get something that was farmed, manufactured and shipped sustainably then that would reward people for going the sustainable route. If everyone did that, then that could change the trajectory of the world.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>The battle against climate change seems endless, but if we all do our parts then we can stop this threat.</h4>
